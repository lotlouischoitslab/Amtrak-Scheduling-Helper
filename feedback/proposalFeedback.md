### Comments
Overall, your proposal is on the right track. 

Please see my comments.

**Leading Questions**
In our previous conversation, you mentioned that you plan to add extra weights to represent the delay that would be caused by having two or more trains on the track at the same time. It is unclear to me how do you add such weight to the graph and how your proposed algorithm may solve the issue. If you decide not to implement this feature, it is fine.  
 
**Data**
How did you plan to convert the distance to time? 

How would you obtain the data on train station connections?

**Algorithm**
You should also include an algorithm from the Complex or Uncovered Options  (https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VL05FxUCQZMLb_jQfsfOMNR56ecxy0aIaqPH6KumBQ/edit).
