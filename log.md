# Development Log

# 3/29 Meeting

1. Our goals for this week were to find the data for the train stations, process the data, and put it into a csv file. We also found the latitude and longitude coordinates of all the stations and got a lot of connections filed in for our csv file. All of these goals were accomplished and we also set up our development environment. 

2. Sam and Josh got the data and created the csv file. We all planned our file structure. Abhi and Louis created the h files and classes. Josh started filling in the Station class, Sam did the Graph class, Abhi did the Data class, and Louis did the Image class. 

3. We did not encounter any problems at this stage.

4. We plan to keep working in the .h and .cpp files and start creating the map with the train stations. 

# 4/5 Meeting

1. Our goals for this week were to finish the function signatures of all of the functions in general for the project.  We added all of the function signatures we could think of at this time but it is likely that we will still be adding in some more function signatures later when we get to those parts and possibly need helper functions.  So we essentially completed all of the work that we have to do for this project but technically it is not 100% as we will be adding in more function signatures for other parts later on.  Another thing we did that was not planned for was figure out the MakeFile and now we are able to compile our code.  Also, we all revised our proposal to include the A* algorithm and get rid of Dijkstra's algorithm (to satisfy the requirements).

2. Josh continued filling in the Station class, Sam continued the Graph class, Abhi continued the Data class, and Louis continued the Image class. Sam and Josh worked on the MakeFile, Abhi and Louis worked on more broad planning.  We all worked on revisions.

3. There are not many problems we encountered right now, the MakeFile was a bit of a challenge to figure out since we had to change our file structure a bit but we got it worked out.

4. We plan to keep working in the .h and .cpp files by implementing more of the functions (and allowing them to interact with eachother), continue a bit more planning, start working on outputting the image, and also continue with data entry.

# 4/12 Meeting
1. Our goals for this week were to finish locate all the amtrak train stations on the US map and display them. This would help us to see the errors in our code and be able to give us the pixel offset from each of the station. 

2. Josh and Sam fixed some files in the data cpp and h file and added functions to read the file. Louis and Abhi tested out drawing the line function in the image class. We all worked on fixing bugs this week.  Josh and Sam also updated and finished all of the data entry.  The Output of all of the stations (displayed on the map) is now in out.png

3. The main problem we had to encounter was git. For Louis, he was somehow in a different branch but he was able to figure it out by removing the separate branch.  We also faced issues with the MakeFile again but we got that fixed by changing the cs225 directory in the MakeFile.

4. We will need to continue working on the DrawPath and then also the next week's tasks. 

# 4/19 Midpoint checkin
Completed:
We have completed Kruskal's algorithm, and implemented basic structure of our project.

Plan:
We have to implement two other algorithms A* and traversal algorithm

Comments from Ziang:
Continue making Test cases. By the end of this week, divide the 2 test cases for the Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree.


# 4/23 Week
All the algorithms including BFS, MST, and A* has been implemented and corresponding test cases have been added. We had problem regrading getters and setters for our class since we didn't plan our class from testing perspective. We added all those helper functions and created proper test suite, testing edge cases as well. 

# 4/26 Week
Completed all the main.cpp functionalities and README.md is done; had a small bug in destructors which we were able to fix pretty quickly.
Whole project is done :D
